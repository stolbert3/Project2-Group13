# Family Meal
##### Project2-Group13

While apps like HotSchedule have created a way to more efficiently store, update, and share schedules in a restaurant, most chefs still use written paper recipes. Paper recipes create the potential for the loss of recipes, limits sharing, and reduces collaboration.

Family Meal will is a dynamic app and API that can be used to store recipes safely, search recipes by ingredients, cuisine styles, allergens, and course types. Chefs or restaurants will be able to link to their recipes for easy reference.
